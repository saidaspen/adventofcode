* The algorithm used, where we split the range upwards or downwards, that is FBFBBFF becoming: 44 
  is in fact the same as the number 0b0101100, thus every time we split to the lower half it is in fact
  equivalent to having a 1 in that position as a number represented in binary. 
  I should recognize this.

Today's problem was tricker than it should have been. I finished in the top 4000, or there about.
I had problems with the language itself, couldn't really figure out how to do it.
I elected for going for a histogram, but at the same time failing to remember that I already have code 
for creating a freqency-map a.k.a. histogram of a given string. 

Anyway. Looking at some of the other participants solutions I realize that it is easier to consider the 
strings as sets and then doing set operation intersection on them.

* Set operation intersect would have been great here.

* It took me about a minute to read the puzzle input. It would have been quicker had I just briefly glanced at it, then check the input, and gotten directly to writing the code.
* Im typing very slowly. There are also a lot of typing mistake. I should really correct that, since it costs me quiet a lot of time.
* When removing stuff, I should really use the IntelliJ commands for +Selection instead of using shift and arrow keys
* When creating a new variable, instead of typing the variable name and then going back to add var, I should just write `var variableName` directly.
* I should try to use IntelliJ for automatically completing code.
